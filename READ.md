Rust Project Compression with Rust
Rust program that uses the flate2 crate to compress a file using gzip compression.

there are a few things I can do to make your code more efficient and performant

Use match expressions to handle errors in a more elegant and concise way. For example, instead of calling unwrap() to unwrap a Result and panic on an error, you can use a match expression to handle the error gracefully:

`let input = match BufReader::new(File::open(args().nth(1).unwrap())) {
Ok(file) => file,
Err(err) => {
eprintln!("Error opening input file: {}", err);
return;
}
};`
Use std::io::BufWriter to buffer the output and reduce the number of times the file is written to. This can improve performance by reducing the number of expensive disk I/O operations.

`let output = BufWriter::new(File::create(args().nth(2).unwrap()).unwrap());`
Use the copy_with_buffer method of std::io::copy to provide a buffer for the copy operation. This can improve performance by reducing the number of calls to the underlying I/O system.

`let buffer_size = 1024 \* 1024; // use a 1 MB buffer
let bytes_copied = std::io::copy(&mut input, &mut encoder)
.expect("Error copying input to output");`
Use std::time::Instant to measure the time it takes to compress the file, and print the results to the console. This can help you understand how long the operation takes and identify areas for optimization.

`let start = Instant::now();
let bytes_copied = std::io::copy(&mut input, &mut encoder)
.expect("Error copying input to output");
let elapsed = start.elapsed();
println!("Elapsed: {:?}", elapsed);
`
